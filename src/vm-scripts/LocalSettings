#
# This file is used by vm-deploy script to get local settings.
 
#
# The vm-container in which to deploy new VMs.
# For now, the vm-deploy is designed to create one single-node
# VM instance on the frontend. In the future, when vm-deploy
# can deploy VM on other or multiple vm-containers,
# this setting will be more meaningful and its format may change.
# But now, just set to the frontend only.
#
vmcontainer=fiji.rocksclusters.org

#
# Gfarm VM disk images directory and database 
#
gfarmvmdir=/vm-images
gfarmvmlist=/vm-images/vmdb.txt

#
# VM image file suffix on your VM hosting server
#
vmsuffix=.hda

#
# Local network settings
#
netmask=255.255.255.0
gateway=198.202.88.20

#
# Reminder of other local settings need to be done:
#
# 1. Set the "scriptdir" in vm-deploy to the scripts installation path
# 2. Add all IP# allocated for vm-deploy script to the AvailableIP file
#
