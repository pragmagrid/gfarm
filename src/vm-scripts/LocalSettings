# 2. Add all IP# allocated for vm-deploy script to the AvailableIP file
# 3. Adjust resolv.conf for your VM
# 4. Create vmdisks group and give it rwx access to VM disk image 
#    directory path on all vm-containers
#    $ ls -ld /state/partition1/xen 
#    drwxr-x--- 4 root vmdisks 4096 Jan  7  2011 /state/partition1/xen
#    $ ls -ld /state/partition1/xen/disks
#    drwxrwx--- 2 root vmdisks 4096 Oct  5 00:05 /state/partition1/xen/disks
# 5. Add the following line in /etc/sudoers on all vm-containers
#    %vmdisks NOPASSWD:/opt/vm-scripts/vm-new, /opt/vm-scripts/vm-makeover, /opt/vm-scripts/vm-start, /opt/vm-scripts/vm-cleanup, /opt/vm-scripts/vm-free
